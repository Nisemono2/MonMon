                <h3>The History of Money</h3>
                <p class="article-text">Money. We all go to work for it, save it, and unfortunately even idolize it but what exactly is it? <u>Money</u> is defined as "the assets, property, and resources owned by someone or something; wealth." Originally, as many may know, money wasn't paper bills or plastic cards but rather materials, livestock, or land. Before paper money became the new norm bartering systems of livestock and property were conducted but as those items are quite difficult to carry around with you people realized they need a new form of currency to alleviate the issue.
                Enter the MIGHTY DOLLAR!!! Well, not yet butttt enter the coin! Now humans could easily transport their wealth with them and because of their relative ease of use, more and more transactions took place which led to thriving business! 
                The video below explains the origin of money in a fun way.</p>
