        <h1>The story behind MonMon</h1>
        <p class="article-text">When I was a kid I saw firsthand the importance and value of financial literacy. My Mom would work multiple jobs to support us but still end up in debt. I decided that I would learn how to fix that problem and create a sustainable life for myself and others. So I set out to learn as much as I could about finance and investing only to be met with an overwhelming sense of confusion. What did sub-prime even mean??? After years of digging through resources I finally emerged with a solid understanding of the fundementals and had a realization. "Why don't I simplify this process by creating a course for others?" Thus, MonMon was created.</p>
